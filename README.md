Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a survey dataset of individuals working in the data field. The goal is to gain insights into various aspects such as demographics, job roles, salaries, and more. The analysis is performed using Power BI, with data cleaning and transformation done in Power Query.

Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is a real-world survey of people working in the data field. It includes information on respondents' demographics, job titles, years of experience, salary ranges, education levels, and other relevant details.

Data Cleaning and Transformation
The data cleaning and transformation process was carried out in Power Query. Here are the steps followed:

Importing Data: The raw survey data was imported into Power Query.
Removing Duplicates: Duplicate entries were identified and removed to ensure data quality.
Handling Missing Values: Missing values were addressed by either filling in with appropriate values or removing incomplete records.
Transforming Data Types: Data types were adjusted as necessary to facilitate analysis (e.g., converting text to dates, numbers, etc.).
Creating New Columns: Additional columns were created to derive new insights (e.g., calculating age groups from birthdates).
Filtering Data: Irrelevant or outlier data points were filtered out to maintain focus on meaningful information.
Dashboard Description
The Power BI dashboard created for this project includes several types of visualizations to provide a comprehensive view of the survey data. Key components of the dashboard are:

Demographics Overview: Charts showing the distribution of respondents by age, gender, and location.
Job Roles and Experience: Visuals illustrating the variety of job roles, years of experience, and their distribution.
Salary Analysis: Graphs and charts analyzing salary ranges across different job roles, experience levels, and education backgrounds.
Education and Skills: Insights into the educational qualifications and key skills of respondents.
Interactive Filters: Slicers and filters to allow users to explore data by different dimensions, such as job role, experience, and location.
How to Use This Project
To explore the Power BI dashboard:

Open the Power BI file: Download and open the provided Power BI file (DataFieldSurvey.pbix).
Navigate the Dashboard: Use the tabs at the bottom to switch between different pages of the dashboard.
Interact with Visuals: Click on various charts and slicers to filter and drill down into the data.
Analyze Insights: Review the visual insights and use the filters to answer specific questions or explore trends.
Conclusion
This Power BI project provides valuable insights into the data field through the analysis of survey data. By following the steps outlined above, users can replicate the data cleaning and transformation process and interact with the dashboard to uncover trends and patterns.
